## Exploring the Curse of Dimensionality and PCA:-

This project explores the **Curse of Dimensionality** in high-dimensional datasets and demonstrates 
how **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** can be used to reduce dimensions effectively. The popular **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** 
is used as a case study.

### What I Learned:-

- As the number of features in a dataset increases, distances between points become less meaningful â€” a phenomenon known as the **Curse of Dimensionality**.
- **PCA** helps reduce dimensions by projecting data onto directions that preserve the most variance.
- Dimensionality reduction can improve computational efficiency, model performance, and data visualization.
